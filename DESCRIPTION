Description: Download data (environmental measurements, sensorstations) from the
    API of open data sensor web platform 'opensensemap.org' for analysis in R.
    This platform provides realtime data of more than 1000 low-cost sensor
    stations for PM10, PM2.5, temperature, humidity, UV-A intensity and more
    phenomena.
    The package aims to be compatible with sf and the tidyverse, and provides
    several helper functions for data exploration and transformation.
