\title{opensensmapr: Get sensor data from opensensemap.org}
\description{
The opensensmapr package provides functions for
\itemize{
  \item retrieval of senseBox metadata,
  \item retrieval of senseBox measurements,
  \item general statistics about the openSenseMap database.
}
Additionally, helper functions are provided to ease the integration with the
\code{\link[sf]{sf}} package for spatial analysis as well as
\code{\link[dplyr]{dplyr}} for general data handling.
}
\section{Retrieving senseBox metadata}{

On the openSenseMap, measurements are provided by sensors which are assigned
to a sensor station ("senseBox").
A senseBox consists of a collection of sensors, a location (-history), an ID,
as well as metadata about its owner & placement.
senseBoxes can be retrieved either by ID, or as a collection with optional
filters on their metadata
\itemize{
  \item \code{\link{osem_box}}: Get metadata about a single box by its ID.
  \item \code{\link{osem_boxes}}: Get metadata about all boxes, optionally
    filtered by their attributes.
}

The data is returned as a \code{\link{data.frame}} with the class
\code{sensebox} attached.
To help in getting an overview of the dataset additional functions are
implemented:
\itemize{
  \item \code{summary.sensebox()}: Aggregate the metadata about the given
    list of senseBoxes.
  \item \code{plot.sensebox()}: Shows the spatial distribution of the given
    list of senseBoxes on a map. Requires additional packages!
  \item \code{\link{osem_phenomena}}: Get a named list with
    counts of the measured phenomena of the given list of senseBoxes.
}
}

\section{Retrieving measurements}{

Measurements can be retrieved through \code{\link{osem_measurements}} for a
given phenomenon only. A subset of measurements may be selected by

\itemize{
  \item a list of senseBoxes, previously retrieved through
    \code{\link{osem_box}} or \code{\link{osem_boxes}}.
  \item a geographic bounding box, which can be generated with the
    \code{\link[sf]{sf}} package.
  \item a time frame
  \item a exposure type of the given box
}

Data is returned as \code{tibble} with the class \code{osem_measurements}.
}

\section{Retrieving statistics}{

Count statistics about the database are provided with \code{\link{osem_counts}}.
}

\section{Integration with other packages}{

The package aims to be compatible with the tidyverse.
Helpers are implemented to ease the further usage of the retrieved data:

\itemize{
  \item \code{\link{osem_as_sensebox}} & \code{\link{osem_as_measurements}}:
    Transform a foreign object to a sensebox data.frame or osem_measurements
    by attaching the required classes and attributes.
  \item \code{\link{st_as_sf.sensebox}} & \code{\link{st_as_sf.osem_measurements}}:
    Transform the senseBoxes or measurements into an \code{\link[sf]{sf}}
    compatible format for spatial analysis.
  \item \code{filter.sensebox()} & \code{mutate.sensebox()}: for use with
    \code{\link{dplyr}}.
}
}
