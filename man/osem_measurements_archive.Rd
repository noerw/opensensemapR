\title{Get day-wise measurements for a single box from the openSenseMap archive.}
\usage{
osem_measurements_archive(x, ...)

\method{osem_measurements_archive}{sensebox}(x, fromDate,
  toDate = fromDate, sensorFilter = ~T, progress = T)
}
\description{
This function is significantly faster than `osem_measurements()` for large
time-frames, as dayly CSV dumps for each sensor from
<archive.opensensemap.org> are used.
Note that the latest data available is from the previous day.
By default, data for all sensors of a box is fetched, but you can select a
subset with a `dplyr`-style NSE filter expression.
