Description: Download environmental measurements and sensor station metadata
    from the API of open data sensor web platform <https://opensensemap.org> for
    analysis in R.
    This platform provides real time data of more than 1500 low-cost sensor
    stations for PM10, PM2.5, temperature, humidity, UV-A intensity and more
    phenomena.
    The package aims to be compatible with 'sf' and the 'Tidyverse', and provides
    several helper functions for data exploration and transformation.
